    <h2>⎯ Our Project Topic ⎯</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        “Just 20 years ago, New York City was racked with crime: murders, 
        burglaries, drug deals, car thefts, thefts from cars” 
        <a href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/how-new-york-became-safe-the-full-story"> (Kelling, 2009)</a>. 
        In the 1990s, New York City was one of the most dangerous cities 
        in America. During that era, under then-mayor Rudolph Giuliani's 
        administration, more laws were passed and enforced to put petty 
        and notorious criminals behind bars. “Over the 1990s, misdemeanor 
        arrests increased 70 percent in New York City… But this 
        decline was not the result of more of those involved in 
        misdemeanors being incapacitated from further crimes by being 
        in prison: prison stays for misdemeanors are short and only 
        9.4 percent of misdemeanor arrests result in a jail sentence, the 
        [co-authors Hope Corman and Naci Mocan] note. Furthermore, 
        an increase in misdemeanor arrests has no impact on the 
        number of murder, assault, and burglary cases, the authors found” 
        <a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/jan03/what-reduced-crime-new-york-city"> (Francis, 2003)</a>. 
        Recently, New York City has been seen in a more positive light, attracting more tourists 
        than ever while consistently increasing safety for citizens. Some new initiatives have even gone so 
        far as implementing robot cops 
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/22/nyregion/police-robot-times-square-nyc.html">(Mays, 2023)</a>. 
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        New York City has tried to curb crime in multiple ways, often to racist and disproportionate ends. 
        One notable case was the stop-and-frisk policy that was popular under the Bloomberg administration 
        from 2002-2013. Stop-and-frisk was a policy where police could stop individuals they suspected of 
        criminal activity, in order to curb low-level crimes. This system was difficult to control since all an 
        officer needed to stop someone was “reasonable suspicion” which was self-defined. In practice, this 
        system targeted people of color disproportionately, where "participants reported a history of 
        stop-and-frisk experience in the prior year, with higher levels among Black (47%) and 
        Hispanic/Latinx (45%) than White (38%) participants" 
        <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0256201"> (Khan et al., 2021)</a>. 
        New York City harmed many minority communities it was meant to protect and did a poor job at curbing crime.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Some may argue that New York City did what was necessary to reduce crime rates, while others may state 
        that implementations were put in place at the cost of minorities’ futures and communities. By taking a 
        look at today’s crime rates and by looking through the eyes of data, we may be able to get a clearer picture 
        of who paid the price for these harsh laws and enforcement and if these punishments are still targeting 
        the same communities.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"><strong>
        Our mission is to understand if communities that were targeted in the past under various 
        administrations are still being targeted more recently in 2023. In addition, we aim to investigate the 
        repercussions and effects of such targeting on the affected communities by combining what we’ve learned 
        from our visualizations and the history of NYC crime law enforcements. We want to look at crime rate in 
        NYC holistically, and tackle the who, what, where, and why crimes are committed in 2023.
        For our analyses, we do not plan to determine whether or not crime rates have increased or decreased in 
        New York City. As a note, our data set looks at arrest rates, not crime rates. Therefore we will not be taking 
        crimes with no associated arrests into account in our analyses.

    <!-- dataset intro begins -->
    <h2>⎯ The Dataset: NYC Open Data - NYPD Arrest Data ⎯</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Our data is from <a href= "https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/"> NYC Open Data</a>, 
        an online data source with a large variety of datasets, mostly focused on 
        statistics from New York City. NYC Open Data host "free public data published by New York City agencies and other partners."
        As such, our data set comes from a reliable source.
        Our data set is titled 
        <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Arrest-Data-Year-to-Date-/uip8-fykc/about_data">“NYPD Arrest Data”</a> 
        and shows all those arrested in 2023.
        It shows many different information regarding an arrest and provides information such as arrest key, 
        date arrested, arrest classification code, level of arrest, reason for arrest, and
        the arrested person race. Some of these attributes are labeled as
        Arrest_Key, Arrest_Date, PD_CD, PD_DESC, KY_CD, OFNS_DESC, Law_Code, etc.
        <strong>The data set has 227,000 rows and 19 columns, with a total of over 4 million data points.</strong>

        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
          For cleaning, we began by deleting the columns that we did not need. These were: 
          ['PD_CD', 'PD_DESC', 'KY_CD', 'LAW_CODE', 'ARREST_PRECINCT', 'X_COORD_CD', 'Y_COORD_CD']. 
          These columns did not assist us in addressing any of the tasks or questions we had. Next, we 
          removed any rows with missing values (NAs). We opted for deletion instead of imputation due to the 
          abundance of data, with over 227,000 rows available. Following this, we identified invalid data by 
          printing out unique values for each column of interest. Rows containing invalid data not 
          documented in the data dictionary were deleted. Additionally, rows where the jurisdiction code was 
          outside of NYC were removed. For instance, some individuals were arrested outside of NYPD jurisdiction, 
          which falls outside the scope of our project. Subsequently, we consolidated all cleaning procedures into a 
          single function, streamlining the data cleaning process. Following this, we conducted exploratory data 
          analysis (EDA) to gain a comprehensive understanding of the data. The visualization below displays the 
          overall data for selected columns of interest.
        </p>
        <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
          To utilize this visualization, please note the dropdown menu option at the bottom of the chart labeled "Selected Column." 
          Select the column you wish to visualize to display the count of each unique value in the chosen column. 
          Also, please be aware that for the column PERP_RACE, the label of the first bar is cut off. It should read 
          as AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE. For any other unique values not explicitly written on the axis, 
          please refer to the table above for their meanings. This visualization aims to provide initial insights into the data, 
          specifically regarding the columns in which we were most interested in during this project work.

    <!-- interactive visualizations start -->
    <h2>⎯ Interactive Visualizations ⎯</h2>
    <h3>Map of NYC Crime Data</h3>
    <iframe class="map" src="Images/Interactive Visualizations/mapsmall.html" width="80%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> <strong>Design Idea of Visualization: </strong>
      This visualization was created using Folium and Geopandas. The data itself included a column for Geopandas to plot it 
      geographically. The map underlying the data points was plotted using another dataset provided in class, containing all 
      the counties in the U.S. By filtering and selecting only the counties in New York, we were able to focus our map solely 
      on NYC.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
      This map of New York City Crime Data serves two main purposes. Firstly, it offers an overall geographical insight into 
      the data. We have mapped all 227,000+ rows of data onto a map of NYC. Secondly, it helps visualize the locations of all 
      the crime data points, aiding in the detection of clusters or patterns present in the data.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
      To utilize this map, the user can simply zoom in or out to explore different areas. The user can also drag the map to 
      focus on specific parts. Each borough is shaded slightly, with its color indicating the density of crime data points 
      within the borough. To view the count of crimes/data points in a borough, click or hover over the shaded shape of the 
      borough. Additionally, the user can inspect individual crime data points by clicking or hovering over a blue dot, 
      representing a singular crime committed in NYC in 2023. When clicked or hovered over, it will display a brief description 
      of the type of crime committed in that area.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> <strong>Takeaways: </strong>
      This map of NYC crime data visualization shows that Brooklyn has the most crime committed, as it is shaded yellow. 
      This may be due to Brooklyn being the most populated borough. We can also see a cluster of crimes being committed in 
      the northern part of Brooklyn. This visualization also helps to show that Staten Island has the least amount of clusters 
      and crimes committed. This may be due to Staten Island having a much smaller population than the other boroughs. Another 
      interesting takeaway is how there seems to be a gap within the middle of the Manhattan borough. This small gap is actually 
      Central Park. Our data shows that Central Park is quite “safe”, considering there are not a lot of crimes being committed or 
      data points in the park itself compared to outside of the park.
    </p>



    <h3>Top 10 Crimes By Frequency Per Borough</h3>
    <iframe class="stacked_barplot" src="Images/Interactive Visualizations/stacked_barplot.html" width="85%" height="700px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> <strong>Design Idea of Visualization: </strong>
      This stacked bar plot was created using Altair and displays the top 10 crimes by frequency per borough. 
      Users can select a specific borough to view the top 10 crimes by frequency using the drop-down button titled 
      “Region.” Initially, the bar plot is stacked to show data for all regions combined, allowing for comparison across 
      boroughs. However, when users select a specific region or borough, they can visualize data for that area specifically.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
      By hovering over the bars, users can view the offense description as well as the specific count for that bar and borough 
      (in the stacked bar version). The design idea for this visualization was to compare the severity of crimes between boroughs. 
      This is important because while all boroughs may experience crime, understanding the severity of crimes committed provides 
      valuable insights that need to be noted and explained.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> <strong>Takeaways: </strong>
      A significant takeaway from this visualization is how Assault 3 & Related Offenses emerge as the most common crime 
      committed across all boroughs, except for Manhattan. Manhattan, being a relatively affluent, densely populated 
      borough and a major tourist destination, may explain why petty larceny (or theft) is the most prevalent crime committed there.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
      Another notable observation is when comparing the top 10 crimes for all boroughs, the green bar representing Assault 3 & Related 
      Offenses is consistently the largest section of the bar, particularly in the Bronx. The Bronx is predominantly known for its Hispanic population.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
      This visualization lends support to the hypothesis that certain communities are targeted more for serious crimes, such as Assault 3 & 
      Related Offenses, as opposed to crimes like petty larceny in Manhattan, which aligns with our research.
    </p>

    

    <!-- static visualizations start -->
    <h2>⎯ Static Visualizations ⎯</h2>
    <h3>Age Distribution by Race</h3>
    <img class="age_distribution_horizontal" width="70%" height="70%" src="Images/Static Visualizations/age_distribution_horizontal.png" alt="Age Distribution Static Visualization" />
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> <strong>Design Idea of Visualization: </strong>
      To examine the age distribution by race in crime, we opted for a grouped bar chart as the 
      most effective means of presenting the information. The graph, created using Matplotlib, 
      categorizes the data into five distinct age groups, with bars colored according to the 
      perpetrators’ race. Incorporating both age and race variables provided valuable insights 
      into the data. Bright colors were chosen for each bar to ensure easy identification in the legend.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> <strong>Takeaways: </strong>
    This grouped bar chart illustrates the age distribution by race in crime. Predominantly, 
    crimes are committed by individuals aged between 25 and 44, aligning with the middle age 
    range. Notably, Black individuals exhibit the highest crime rates across all age groups, 
    followed by White Hispanics. This observation suggests a potential disproportionality in 
    arrest rates targeting Black individuals compared to other races. Conversely, American 
    Indian/Alaskan Natives and individuals of unknown races are minimally represented, reflecting 
    their low population numbers in New York City.
    </p>



    <h3>Crime Frequency By Month and Borough</h3>
    <img class="crime_frequency_plot" width="70%" height="70%" src="Images/Static Visualizations/crime_frequency_plot.png" alt="Crime Frequency Static Visualization" />
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> <strong>Design Idea of Visualization: </strong>
      This design is a line chart of crime frequency over time by borough, which was made using 
      Altair. We thought that a line chart would be a good way to represent the data because 
      it shows the changes in each month easily. It also allowed us to compare all of the 
      different boroughs by having different colored lines. The legend makes it easy to see 
      which borough has the highest and lowest crime frequency. We have the month on the 
      x-axis and the crime frequency count on the y-axis.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> <strong>Takeaways: </strong>
      For our line chart of crime frequency over time by borough, the lines show the 
      changes in crime frequency throughout the year for each of the boroughs in our 
      dataset. We thought that this was a really interesting way to see how different 
      boroughs had different crime numbers. As you can see here, Staten Island is an 
      outlier due to how low the crime frequency is and how consistent the crime rate is 
      throughout the year. This makes sense when you compare the low population of around 
      8,000 people to the other boroughs. Brooklyn has the most crime, which is interesting 
      because it is the most populated borough, but not the most densely populated borough, 
      which is Manhattan.
    </p>


    
    <h3>Percentage of Offense Level by Race</h3>
    <iframe src="Images/Static D3 Visualization/SVindex.html" width="100%" height="600px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> <strong>Design Idea of Visualization: </strong>
      This visualization, implemented with D3, illustrates the percentage of offense levels by race in 
      a bar chart format. Choosing a bar chart was appropriate since "Offense Level" was a categorical 
      variable in our dataset, with only “Felony”, “Misdemeanor”, and “Violation” as values of interest. 
      Although "Infraction" is also listed as a value for "Offense Level" in our data introduction table and 
      Overall Visualization of Multiple Attributes of The Data chart, it was not considered due to its minimal 
      occurrence and relatively minor nature (typically breach of contracts). Grouping the bars by race 
      allowed for the examination of whether the distribution of offense levels varied across races. 
      Additionally, utilizing percentages helped normalize the data across races, enabling comparison of 
      the proportions of different severity levels of crimes committed within each race. Bright colors 
      were chosen for the bars to ensure clear visibility against the light blue backdrop of the SVG.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> <strong>Takeaways: </strong>
      The bar chart illustrating the percentage of offense levels by race may reveal a consistent distribution across 
      all races initially. However, the significant takeaway is how the difference in proportion between felony and 
      misdemeanor across all races differs. Firstly, the dominance of misdemeanor across all races as the most 
      common offense level aligns with its intermediary position between violation and felony. Misdemeanor offenses 
      include trespassing, shoplifting, DUI, etc. Felony offenses include rape, murder, assault, drug possession, 
      etc. Conversely, violation emerged as the least common offense level, reflecting its non-criminal nature and 
      absence of jail time consequences. Violation offenses include illegal parking, failure to yield, speeding, drag 
      racing, etc. Returning to the takeaway, while the chart may appear equal for all races regarding committing different 
      severity of crimes, through our visualization, we observe how the proportions between felony offenses and misdemeanor 
      offenses differ significantly for each race. Simply comparing Black New Yorkers with White New Yorkers, we notice that 
      while Black New Yorkers have a lower percentage of misdemeanor offenses than White New Yorkers, they have a much higher 
      percentage of felony offenses. Additionally, the proportion of misdemeanor offenses to felony offenses for Black New Yorkers 
      is markedly different from the proportion for White New Yorkers. This disparity is evident by examining the gaps of the bars 
      between misdemeanor offenses and felony offenses for the different races. Moreover, Black New Yorkers exhibit a slightly 
      higher felony offense rate compared to all other races. This discrepancy may be attributed to how Black New Yorkers are 
      targeted more or charged for higher-level crimes for stronger punishment, perhaps even when it is not warranted.

    <h2>⎯ Summary, Takeaways, and Future Work ⎯</h2>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Based on our 'Crime Frequency By Month and Borough' static visualization as well as our interactive map, Brooklyn emerges 
        as the epicenter of criminal activity. Predominantly, these crimes were committed by Black New Yorkers aged 
        between 25 to 44 as seen in our 'Age Distribution by Race' static visualization. Our 
        'Top 10 Crimes By Frequency Per Borough' interactive visualization shows that the most prevalent offense is assault in the 
        third degree, involving the intentional harming of another person. Lastly, our 'Percentage of Offense Level by Race' 
        static visualization shows that the proportion of felony crimes to misdemeanor crimes is much higher for Black New Yorkers 
        compared to other races. While the chart might initially appear to suggest equal distribution of crimes across different 
        racial groups, it actually highlights the disproportionate prevalence of more severe crimes among Black New Yorkers in 
        relation to less severe offenses. Synthesizing insights from our visualizations and extensive research into NYC's crime history, it becomes 
        evident that there exists a discernible ripple effect stemming from the intense targeting of a specific community.
    </p>
     <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        Between 2002 and 2013, the implementation of the 'Stop and Frisk' policy empowered NYC police officers to detain individuals 
        deemed "suspicious," disproportionately impacting the Black community. Consequently, many individuals were unjustly 
        incarcerated for minor offenses, leading to the occurrence of more serious crimes. This harmful cycle perpetuated by 
        discriminatory practices significantly contributes to heightened crime rates within affected communities, as illustrated by 
        our side-by-side static bar plot, the Age Distribution by Race plot. In addition, the line plot showed how crime 
        throughout the year was fairly consistent, showing a steady pattern of criminal activity. The concentration of criminal 
        activity in Brooklyn is because Brooklyn is the most populous borough in NYC.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        In conclusion, our analysis has successfully addressed the tasks of NYC crime data, including the who, what, 
        where, and why behind these patterns. By examining the relationship between historical crime policies and their 
        effects on boroughs and communities todays, we could discern a clear trend and pattern highlighting how a history of 
        flawed crime-related policies can impact both boroughs and its people.
    </p>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;">
        As we reflect on our project, we recognize the potential for further investigation into the influence of 
        additional factors such as economic status and education on crime rates across diverse communities. 
        While our current analysis has shed light on the impact of crime-related policies on communities, 
        it is essential to acknowledge that policies operate at several removes from the everyday experiences of 
        individuals, particularly in comparison to the direct effects of education and economic circumstances. 
        Exploring these interconnected dynamics through data could shed more light on why crimes are committed.
        Therefore, future endeavors might involve delving deeper into these variables, examining their 
        complex interactions with crime patterns, and elucidating how addressing socio-economic disparities 
        could contribute to more effective crime prevention strategies and community well-being.
